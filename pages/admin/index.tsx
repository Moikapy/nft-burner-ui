      This page shows a form that the user creating the burner can fill. For now
      there are only 3 fields: - Whitelisted NFT creator ID - Amount of SPL
      token received upon burn completion - Number of NFT to burn to get one
      unit of amount of this burnerâ€™s SPL token - Amount of SPL token to be
      deposited for this burner (will then trigger a transaction). Can be
      triggered multiple times to add more SPL token if needed. - Withdraw a
      certain amount of the SPL token from the burner.
